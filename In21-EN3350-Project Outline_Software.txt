1.​Overview
1.1.​Background
Power utilities perform routine thermal inspections of distribution transformers to detect anomalies like
overheating, insulation degradation, and load imbalances. Currently, these inspections rely on manual
comparison of thermal images, making them time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. There is a
strong need to automate and digitize this workflow while ensuring traceability, efficiency, and
adaptability.

1.2.​Your Challenge
Design and develop a complete software solution that allows users to:
1.​ Record and manage transformers and their associated image data
2.​ Automatically detect temperature anomalies in new images using computer vision
3.​ Allow users to manually validate or correct detected anomalies
4.​ Generate a maintenance record sheet with marked anomalies and editable fields
This project will be executed in four phases, and your solution must support the flow of data and insights
across all of them.

4.​Phase 2 – Automated Anomaly Detection
4.1.​Overview
In Phase 2, you will build and integrate an AI-based engine to automatically detect thermal anomalies in
transformer images. This is a critical capability in digitizing and scaling thermal inspection workflows.
Your task is to compare new (maintenance) thermal images with previously stored baseline images,
identify deviations such as hotspots, and present them to the user in a clear and intuitive interface. The
system must support comparison logic, anomaly detection based on pre-defined thresholds, and a visual
display that helps users understand the insights derived by the AI model.

5.​Phase 3 – Interactive Annotation & Feedback
5.1.​Overview
In Phase 2, you developed a system that automatically detects anomalies in transformer thermal images.
In Phase 3, you will extend this functionality by enabling human-in-the-loop feedback through
interactive annotation tools. This allows engineers or admin users to validate, correct, or reject detected
anomalies and add their own annotations where necessary. This phase is essential to enhance the
system’s accuracy and usability in real-world operations, as manual oversight plays a key role in critical
maintenance workflows. Additionally, user corrections and annotations must be stored for potential
model retraining or analysis in later phases.

5.2.​Scope

○​ Optional comments or notes
○​ Timestamp and user ID
FR3.2: Metadata and Annotation Persistence
●​ When a user interacts with the anomaly detection view, all changes must be:
○​ Captured and saved in the backend
○​ Stored along with metadata (user ID, timestamp, image ID, transformer ID, action taken)
○​ Shown in the UI
●​ Existing annotations should be automatically reloaded when the same image is revisited.
FR3.3: Feedback Integration for Model Improvement
●​ Maintain a feedback log that includes:
○​ Original AI-generated detections
○​ Final user-modified annotations

●​ Use the user-modified annotations to improve the accuracy of the AI model
●​ The feedback log must be exportable in JSON or CSV format with:
○​ Image ID

○​ Model-predicted anomalies
○​ Final accepted annotations
○​ Annotator metadata
●​ Saving previous versions of the annotated image in the user interface and switching between them is not
within the scope of this project.
Additional Technical Requirements:
●​ Annotation tools must be intuitive and user-friendly (use standard UI components where possible)
●​ All annotation actions must be logged without requiring the user to manually "save"
●​ Store image-to-annotation relationships in a structured and queryable format (relational DB or NoSQL)

●​ Extended UI Designs: Annotated mockups showing the expected interaction flow (edit/delete/add
annotations) - refer to the Phase 3 explanation video

6.​Phase 4 – Maintenance Record Sheet Generation
6.1.​Overview
In the final phase of this project, your team will implement the functionality to generate transformer-specific
